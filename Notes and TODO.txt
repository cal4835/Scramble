Lab 12 Notes and TODO

Notes (things for future engancements and other stuff): 

- Work on Scrambler so that two arrays don't have to be intialized manually
- Admin functionality to add words to the array may be useful
	- Use GetString to put words into the array (queues to add/remove?)
	- Check for a confirmation (Y/N)
	- Word is added to the array
	- This will only work if the scramblizer works too
- Don't think I will have time to use LED's in the school year, implement better LED usage,
  buttons, etc. on an external breadboard
- Ask Melton if there is a way to better automate things

TODO:
- Finish initializing arrays
- Implement the game aspects
	- play a game
	- timer (PIT)
	- LED	(GPIO)
- Test successful and unsuccessful scrambles
